Prerequisites
--------------
Make sure you have python and libboost-all-dev installed. Some tests also require gnugo.


Build
-----
To build all tests and the AI itself:

    $ python build.py > build_log


How to play against the AI
--------------------------
I recommend you use a GUI that supports GTP, such as GoGTP, and connect it to bin/go_gtp.
